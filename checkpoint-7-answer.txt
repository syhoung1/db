1.  SELECT * FROM guests
    LEFT OUTER JOIN bookings
    ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id;

    SELECT * FROM bookings
    JOIN guests ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    JOIN rooms ON rooms.id = bookings.room_id
    WHERE bookings.checked_in_date = example_date;

    SELECT * FROM bookings
    JOIN guests ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    JOIN rooms ON rooms.id = bookings.room_id;

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT guests)
    FROM guests
    JOIN bookings ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    JOIN rooms ON rooms.id = bookings.room_id;

2.  The students entity will have basic information about a student, namely name
    and email stored as texts.
    
    The classes entity will have information such as name and subject stored as
    texts as well.
    
    To connect the two we would need an enrollment entity that keeps track of
    information about students within a class. Letter grades could be stored as
    text and percentage grades could be stored as a float.
    
3.  SELECT * FROM students
    JOIN enrollment ON students.id = enrollment.student_id
    JOIN classes ON enrollment.class_id = class.id AND class.name = target_name;

    SELECT COUNT(grades), grades
    FROM classes
    JOIN enrollment ON class.id = enrollment.class_id
    GROUP BY grades
    ORDER BY grades DESC;

    SELECT class.name, COUNT(students)
    FROM enrollment
    JOIN students ON student.id = enrollment.student_id
    JOIN class ON class.id = enrollment.class_id
    
    SELECT MAX(COUNT(students)), class
    FROM enrollment
    JOIN class ON enrollment.id = enrollment.class_id
    GROUP BY class;
