3.  You could determine the display order of the rows you're given by appending
    ORDER BY at the end of your select statement.
    
4.  OFFSET could be used to select the first 10 qualifying winners in a
    sweepstake or giveaway.

5.  If you don't use ORDER BY you could end up with different results every
    time you SELECT.

6.  HAVING filters out results after they have been grouped by an aggregate
    function, whereas WHERE would filter out before.

7.   SELECT id, SUM (amount)
     FROM payment
     GROUP BY user
     HAVING SUM (amount) > 200;

8.  SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY intake_date;
    SELECT * FROM adoptions ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 5;
    SELECT * FROM cats GROUP BY gender HAVING gender = 'F' AND age > 2;
