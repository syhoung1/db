1.  To add: INSERT INTO table VALUES values;
    To update: UPDATE table SET values;
    To delete: UPDATE table DELETE values;

2.  Adding creates a new row within the given table and populates it with the
    values passed in.
    
    Updating looks for the row in the given table that matches the one that the
    user is looking for and then updates the data with the values that are
    passed in.
    
    Delete searches for the row in the given table and then deletes the values
    in the specified columns.

3.  Texts, integers and dates are data types that can be stored. In a
    hospital's patient database, for example, the patient names could be stored
    as Texts; the patient's height and weight could be stored as integers; and
    the patient's last check-in date could be stored as a date.

4.  First and last name would be stored as Text values. RSVPs are boolean
    values. Number of guests and meals are both integers.
